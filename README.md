# CaseStudyDDS

The purpose of the project is to predict the retention rate among employees in the united States.

The project also aims to find the best regression model based on the Employee's monthly income.

The file the data was extracted from are the "CaseStudy2-data.csv" file.

I plan to visualize and analyse our data using various data science tools like file manipulation, string manipulation, ggplots, knn classifications, naive bayes classification, logistic regression and linear regression.
